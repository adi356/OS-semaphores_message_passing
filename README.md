# OS-semaphores_message_passing

# TO RUN
1. Make sure no straggling files by first typing 'make clean'
2. Type 'make' to create executables
3. Use command './master -t ss n' to run program, where ss is timeout and n is number of processes 1-20 (note: if you enter a number higher than 20 the program will still only create 20 processes)
4. Use 'make clean' to delete executables, logfiles, and cstest
## Purpose

The goal of this program is to become familiar with semaphores in Linux. It is a repetition of your last project with the part that was handled by the concurrency algorithm to be implemented by semaphores.

You will again use multiple concurrent processes to write into a file at random times, solving the concurrency issues using semaphores for synchronization of processes. Your job is to create the environment such that two processes cannot write into the file simultaneously and yet, every process gets its turn to write into the file.

## Task

Generate twenty processes using a master program, called **master**, and make them write into a file called **cstest** in their current working directory. Needless to say that all processes will use the same working directory. Each child process will be executed by an executable called **slave**. The message to be written into the file is:

`HH:MM:SS File modified by process number xx`

where **HH:MM:SS** is the current sytem time, **xx** is the logical process number as specified by **master**. The value of **xx** is between 1 and 20. This implies that the child process will be run my the command: 

`slave xx`

The critical resource is the file **cstest** which should be updated by a child under exclusive control access. This implies that each **slave** will have a critical section that will control access to the file to write into it.

### The main program **master**

Write **master** that runs up to _n_ **slave** processes at a time. Make sure that **n** never exceeds 20. Start **master** by typing the following command:

`master -t ss n`

where **ss** is the maximum time in seconds (default 100 seconds) after which the process should terminate itself if not completed.

Implement **master** as follows:
1. Check for the command line argument and output a usage message if the argument is not appropriate. If **n** is more than 20, issue a warning and limit **n** to 20. It will be a good idea to **#define** the maximum value of **n** or keep it as configurable.
2. Allocate any shared memory needed as well as semaphores, and initialize them appropraitely.
3. Execute the **slave** processes and wait for all of them to terminate.
4. Start a timer for specified number of seconds (default: 100). If all children have not terminated by then, terminate the children.
5. Deallocate shared memory and semaphores and terminate.

### The Application Program (**slave**)

The **slave** just writes the message into the file inside the critical section. We want to have some log messages to see that the process is behaving appropriately and it does follow the guidance required for critical section.

If a process starts to execute code to enter the critical section, it must print a message to that effect in its own log file. I'll suggest naming the log file as **logfile.xx** where **xx** is the process number for the child, passed via the command line. It will be a good idea to include the time when that happens. Also, indicate the time in the log file when the process actually enters and exits the critical section. Within the critical section, wait for a random number of seconds (in the range [1,3]) before you write into the file, and then, wait for another [1,3] seconds before leaving the critical section. For each child process, tweak the code so that the process requests and enters the critical section at most five times.

The code for each child process should use the following template:

```
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
{
  wait for semaphore;
  sleep for random amount of time (between 1 and 3 seconds);
  critical_section();
  sleep for random amount of time (between 1 and 3 seconds);
  signal on semaphore;
}
```

Unlike last project, you do not have to specify the number of processes that participate in the critical section. However, you should keep the number of processes that can be forked concurrently under 20. The number of processes actually forked will come from the number specified on command line when you start the program. This implies that the **master** will stop forking processes as the limit is reached and will fork more only after some previously forked process terminates.

## Implementation

You will be required to create the specified number of separate **slave** processes from your **master**. That is, the **master** will just spawn the child processes and wait for them to finish. The **master** process also sets a timer at the start of computation to specified number of seconds. If computation has not finished by this time, the **master** kills all the **slave** processes and then exits. Make sure that you print appropriate message(s).

**master** will also allocate shared memory for synchronization purposes. It will open and close a **logfile** but will not open **cstest**. **cstest** will be opened by the child process as it enters critical section (before the **sleep**) and closed as it exits.

In addition, **master** should also print a message when an interrupt signal (**^C**) is received. The child processes just ignore the interrupt signals (no messages on screen). Make sure that the processes handle multiple interrupts correctly. As a precaution, add this feature only after your program is well debugged.

The code for **master** and **slave** processes should be compiled separately and the executables be called **master** and **slave**.

Other points to remember: you are required to use **fork**, **exec** (or one of its variants), **wait**, and **exit** to manage multiple processes. Use **shmctl** suite of calls for shared memory allocation, if needed. Use **semctl** suite of system calls to handle semaphores. Make sure that you never have more than 20 processes in the system at any time, even if I specify a larger number in the command line (issue a warning in such a case).

## Invoking the solution

**master** should be invoked using the following command:

`master -t ss n`

#### Termination Criteria:
There are several termination criteria. First, if all the **slaves** have finished, **master** should deallocated shared memory and semaphore, and terminate.

In addition, I expect your program to terminate after the specified amount of time as specified in **config.h**. This can be done using a timeout signal, at which point it should kill all currenlty running child processes and terminate. It should also catch the **ctrl-c** signal, free up shared memory and then terminate all children. No matter how it terminates, **master** should also output the time of termination to the log file.

#### <ins>Hints</ins>
You will need to set up semaphores in this project to allow the processes to synchronize with each other. Please check the man pages for **semget**, **semctl**, and **semop** to work with semaphores. Do not forget to use **perror** to help with any debugging.

You will also need to set up signal processing and to do that, you will check on the functions for **signal** and **abort**. If you abort a process, make sure that the parent cleans up any allocated shared memory and semaphore before dying.

Make any error messages meaningful, the format for error messages should be:

`master: Error: detailed error message`

where **master** is actuallly the name of the executable (**argv[0]**) that you are trying to execute. These error messages may be sent to **stderr** using **perror**. Make judicious use of **perror** with all system calls; it will help you debug quickly in case of trouble.
